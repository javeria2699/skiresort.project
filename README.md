## 📌 Project Objectives

- Identify top-performing resorts by total slopes and lift capacity.
- Analyze elevation differences to find resorts with thrilling vertical drops.
- Segment resorts based on skill level, family-friendliness, and lift infrastructure.
- Use SQL CTEs to produce analytical insights.

## 🗃️ Dataset Overview

The dataset (`resorts.csv`) includes the following key columns:

- `Resort`, `Country`, `Continent`
- `Price`, `Season`, `Highest point`, `Lowest point`
- `Beginner slopes`, `Intermediate slopes`, `Difficult slopes`, `Total slopes`
- `Lift capacity`, `Child friendly`, `Snowparks`, `Nightskiing`, `Summer skiing`
- Lift types: `Surface lifts`, `Chair lifts`, `Gondola lifts`

## 🔍 SQL Techniques Used

- `SELECT`, `WHERE`, `ORDER BY`, `GROUP BY`, `HAVING`
- Aggregate functions: `COUNT()`, `AVG()`, `MAX()`
- Filtering with `IN`, `BETWEEN`, `LIKE`
-  `WITH` statements (CTEs)

Use Case Example
“How can we recommend the most suitable ski resorts to travelers based on their budget, skill level, family needs, and seasonal preferences?”

This project provides the SQL logic to answer this business question and supports decision-making for travel platforms or ski resort operators.
